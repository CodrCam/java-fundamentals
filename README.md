## Lab 6 & 7

This application allows users to review various types of establishments, such as restaurants, shops, and theaters. It consists of multiple classes, including `User`, `Review`, `Restaurant`, `Shop`, and `Theater`. The `Reviewable` interface is implemented by `Restaurant`, `Shop`, and `Theater` to ensure that they can all be reviewed.
